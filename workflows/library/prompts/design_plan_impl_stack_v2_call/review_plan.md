Read the `Consumed Artifacts` section first and treat it as the authoritative input list.
Read the consumed `design`, `plan`, and `open_findings` artifacts before acting.

First, review the current plan from scratch.
Then reconcile your fresh review against the carried-forward `open_findings` ledger.

For each prior finding, classify it as one of:
- `RESOLVED`
- `STILL_OPEN`
- `SUPERSEDED`
- `SPLIT`

You may add `NEW` findings only if they are materially distinct.
Do not preserve a finding only because it existed before.

Write JSON to the `plan_review_report_path` path specified in the Output Contract using this shape:

```json
{
  "decision": "APPROVE",
  "summary": "short summary",
  "unresolved_high_count": 0,
  "unresolved_medium_count": 0,
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "PLAN-H1",
      "status": "RESOLVED",
      "severity": "high",
      "title": "short title",
      "description": "short explanation",
      "evidence": ["path#L1"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Also write:
- `APPROVE` or `REVISE` to the `plan_review_decision` path specified in the Output Contract
- the unresolved high count integer to the `unresolved_high_count` path specified in the Output Contract
- the unresolved medium count integer to the `unresolved_medium_count` path specified in the Output Contract

Approve only if there are no unresolved high findings and the plan is ready to execute.
